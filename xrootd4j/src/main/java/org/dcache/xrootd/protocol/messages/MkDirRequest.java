      According to the xrootd protocol spec http://xrootd.org/doc/dev45/XRdv310.htm#_Toc464248821,
      kXR_mkdir and kXR_open operations  both accept kXR_mkpath as one of these flags
      that affect the behaviour of these commands.
      Nonethenless kXR_mkdir does not accept kXR_mkpath in options field
      https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/815.
      This is wrong as the xrootd code uses bit-0 in kXR_mkdir options to indicate parent directory
      elements should be created, whereas kXR_open uses bit-8 for the same behaviour.
      Therefore, the flags cannot be described using the same constant (kXR_mkpath).
      This is the reason  why dCache could not support kXR_mkpath option.

      This  is modified  to use kXR_mkdirpath one of  mkdir oprtions instead  of kXR_mkpath.
      Note that is is temporal workaround. And code should be changed once the issue is fixed.
